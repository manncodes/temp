        "# Programming (Not Prompting) Your LLM with DSPy\n",
        "\n",
        "DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Python) is a framework from Stanford NLP that treats language models as programmable functions rather than prompt templates. It provides a PyTorch-like interface for defining, composing, and optimizing LLM operations. Instead of writing and maintaining complex prompts, developers specify input/output signatures and let DSPy handle prompt engineering and optimization. The framework enables systematic improvement of LLM pipelines through techniques like automatic prompt tuning and self-improvement.\n",

        "Majority is a utility function that implements a basic voting mechanism across multiple completions to determine the most common answer. It works by taking either a Prediction object (which contains completions) or a list of completions directly, then normalizes their values for the target field (either specified or defaults to the last output field). The normalization process, handled by normalize_text, helps manage slight variations in text that should be considered the same answer (returning None for answers that should be ignored). In cases of ties, earlier completions are prioritized. The function is particularly useful when combined with modules that generate multiple completions (like running predictors with different temperatures) and you want a simple way to find the most common response. The function returns a new Prediction object containing just the winning completion."

        "\n",
        "DSPy's documentation highlights two key points about using modules as metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. If your metric is itself a DSPy program, one of the most powerful ways to iterate is to compile (optimize) your metric itself. That's usually easy because the output of the metric is usually a simple value (e.g., a score out of 5) so the metric's metric is easy to define and optimize by collecting a few examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. When your metric is used during evaluation runs, DSPy will not try to track the steps of your program. But during compiling (optimization), DSPy will trace your LM calls. The trace will contain inputs/outputs to each DSPy predictor and you can leverage that to validate intermediate steps for optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Digging into the second point with our prior example, the metric operates in two modes:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Standard Evaluation (trace=None)**: Returns a normalized score (0-1) based on accuracy and conciseness of the summary, requiring factual accuracy as a gating factor.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Compilation Mode (trace available)**: During compilation, DSPy provides us with the trace of our ChainOfThought module `(dialog_sum)`. While our standard evaluation returns a normalized score between 0-1, in compilation mode we alter the return logic to instead provide a binary success criterion `(score >= 2)`. This binary signal helps DSPy optimize more effectively during compilation by providing a clear success/failure signal for each example.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def dialog_metric(gold, pred, trace=None):\n",
        "    dialogue, gold_summary, generated_summary = gold.dialogue, gold.summary, pred.summary\n",

        "    concise = dspy.Predict(Assess)(assessed_text=generated_summary, assessment_question=concise_question)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    if trace is not None:\n",
        "        # During compilation: Can access and validate CoT reasoning steps\n",
        "        # We're not doing anything with it currently but you can access in this way\n",
        "        reasoning_steps = [output.reasoning for *_, output in trace if hasattr(output, 'reasoning')]\n",
        "        # Return binary success criteria for optimization\n",
        "        return score >= 2  # Requires both accuracy and conciseness\n",
        "    \n",
        "    return score / 2.0  # Normalized evaluation score\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The trace functionality is particularly valuable for complex modules like our ChainOfThought implementation as it alters how DSPy handles optimization. During compilation, instead of returning normalized scores, we provide binary success signals based on specific criteria (score >= 2). This binary feedback helps DSPy more effectively optimize the model by providing clear success/failure signals for each example.\n",
        "\n",
        "This dual-mode evaluation strategy serves two distinct purposes. During normal evaluation, we get detailed normalized scores to assess model performance. During compilation, we switch to binary success criteria to guide optimization more effectively. This approach helps us maintain rich evaluation metrics while providing clearer signals for model improvement during the compilation phase. We could also further complicate this by including signals from intermediate steps that are generally obfuscated."

        "Overall DSPy provides an interesting approach to applying language models within programs, abstracting away from trial and error via prompting by adding rigour around clear metric definition and optimization. Rather than work with difficult to interpret or tune text strings, they offer a clean base template that can be further optimized through algorithmic approaches, applying automated ways to coordinate or generate few shot examples, directly change the instructions given to the LLM, or a combination of the two.\n",

        "Inspired by deep learning frameworks, DSPy offers a powerful way to reliably optimize and iterate on LLM applications in a systematic and controlled way, with the entire ecosystem growing by the day. Go give [the DSPy repo](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/tree/main) a star!"
